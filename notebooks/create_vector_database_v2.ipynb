            "AltA is the deliberate application of independent, critical thought and alternative perspective to improve decision-making.  \n",
            "The key words in this description are independent, critical thought, and alternative perspective. First, independent refers to being free from influence or control by others in matters of belief or thinking. Second, critical thought – also known as critical thinking – is the intellectually disciplined process of conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing, and evaluating information. It is necessary for valid reasoning when drawing conclusions about goals, problems, assumptions, concepts, evidence, implications, and consequences. Finally, alternative perspective is the result of looking at a situation, problem, or fact through a different mindset, cultural frame, or value and belief structure.  \n",
            "In other words, AltA is a capability to look at problems in a different way in order to make better-informed decisions. It aims to improve innovation and creativity and to broaden understanding within the staff. To this end, it provides a vehicle to better comprehend the scope of the problem for which staff officers are seeking solutions. Hence, AltA supports them in producing enhanced output in a more efficient manner than relying on unstructured staff meetings or processes. Nevertheless, AltA is intended to supplement rather than duplicate functions performed by staff officers.  \n",
            "AltA comprises of a set of simple techniques that enrich existing processes. They have been taken from industry, intelligence, and academic best practices and are tried-andtested approaches for problem-solving and decision-making. Some techniques such as mind mapping or brainstorming will be familiar to many, others may be less so. The techniques have been specifically chosen as ones that are most useful for NATO.  \n",
            "The AltA capability is aimed at the NATO staff officer; as such, no prior experience or analysis training is necessary. Having said that, experienced analysts will find the techniques a useful complement to their skill set, and the capability is available to non-NATO staff officers.  \n",
            "The AltA capability consists of three main areas: (1) the techniques themselves, (2) education and training in the form of a training course at NATO School Oberammergau, and (3) a community of AltA faclitators. The latter share experiences on NATO’s Transformation Network (TRANSNET) portal under https://portal.transnet.act.nato.int/ Pages/home.aspx (register there for “Operational Analysis, Research and Assessment”).\n",

            "Staff often face complicated tasks. In many instances, not only the answer to a question, but even the question itself and the context surrounding it may be uncertain. This is further aggravated by a lack of specific guidance. Moreover, many staff officers are on a short (three-year) tour of duty, which poses limitations on their ability to become subject-matter experts in the problem. To overcome these challenges, AltA offers techniques that can provide an initial starting point for a task, explore the issues, or generate motivating ideas to start tackling the problem.  \n",
            "Proficient English speakers tend to dominate meetings. International staff consist of members from many different nations with differing language skills. Some staff take longer to process their thoughts into English and can be dominated by those who think and talk quickly without hesitation. AltA addresses this problem by employing techniques that give participants time to gather their thoughts or use visual records to help people remember what was said. Additionally, its methods encourage round-table contributions where everyone gets an opportunity to express their views as well as writing sessions where thoughts are put on paper in silence.  \n",
            "Meetings can be unproductive. The pitfall of long, boring, badly structured, or indecisive meetings without a palpable result is all too common. When employed, the AltA techniques described in this handbook can help to provide structure to a meeting, and some of them also often save time. Likewise, they can produce a tangible, shared outcome that may serve as foundation for follow-up processes.  \n",

            "AltA techniques seek to combat biases. A bias is an inclination – either consciously realized or completely unknown to a person – to present or be pre-disposed towards a particular perspective. This is often accompanied by an intentional or unintentional refusal to reflect upon the possible merits of alternative points of view. Such cognitive biases are present in every individual. AltA techniques tackle them by highlighting and evaluating other perspectives, by focussing on the issue instead of the person expressing it, and by managing arguments in a constructive way.  \n",
            "Biases may appear at group and/or organizational level, too. They can become prevalent in large organizations, especially when there is a high pressure to deliver output. Often it is easier just to agree rather than to upset existing group norms or to fight against established organizational procedures. Operations, working groups on exercises, or day-today office life can easily fall foul of such biases. This is particularly common when the same team has worked together for several months or much time and money has been invested in a project. While considering the permanency of social and cultural factors that exist in NATO, the application of AltA techniques present a useful and viable mitigation for common pitfalls due to biases in the decision-making process.  \n",

            "AltA is intended to be flexible and widely applicable. It builds on existing staff and analytical capabilities where they are available instead of introducing a new entity or staff structure. Generally speaking, AltA rests on eight principles:  \n",
            "(1) AltA is a capability. It is a capability consisting of techniques, training and education, and personnel. This capability is adaptable to meet each organization’s unique needs. For example, a strategic command might organize an ad hoc team to analyse an issue of strategic importance to the Alliance. The operational level might establish a standing team to assist in operations planning and assessment. Other organizations meanwhile might desire staff-wide implementation of these analytical skills to support deeper understanding of the topics they examine.  \n",
            "(2) AltA supports problem-solving. It is performed to support a problem owner with creative problem-solving resources rather than to provide a stand-alone solution to a problem. AltA enhances thinking and creativity with a set of practical and mostly easy-to-apply techniques.  \n",
            "(3) AltA can support a wide range of problems at any level of staff. It has broad applicability, from supporting a single staff officer faced with a problem to the complex decisions encountered by a large staff organization. The AltA techniques have been drawn from national defence organizations, industry, and academia and have been widely used. Learning AltA techniques gives a lifelong career skill set.  \n",
            "(4) AltA provides an independent perspective. To be of value to a decisionmaking process, AltA must be free to deliver impartial or “out-of-the-box” thought that is not constrained by traditional hierarchal structures or organizational pressures.  \n",
            "(5) AltA depends on mutual understanding to realize its full benefits. Problem owners must be willing to accept that the AltA process might be controversial. Simultaneously, AltA must respect the supported/supporting nature of the relationship and be sensitive to the potential impact of its product.  \n",
            "(6) AltA is best applied throughout a process. Its early engagement is ideal to present alternative perspectives and insights in order to better inform the supported process.  \n",
            "(7) AltA benefits from formal direction and guidance. Leaders can help by creating an organizational culture that is willing to use AltA to challenge beliefs and perspectives. The intended use of AltA should be tailored to the organization’s needs without constraining independence and flexibility.  \n",
            "(8) AltA complements existing functions within an organization. It is designed to complement and draw from other existing functions (e.g. operational analysis, operations planning), not to replace or duplicate them.  \n",
            "The AltA process consists of four broad phases: initiation, preparation, application, and termination. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to the AltA process, which is depicted in Figure 1. It offers advice and highlights considerations for the successful application of AltA techniques.  \n",
            "AltA is applicable to any task where it is believed to improve the outcome. For simple applications, e.g. where staff officers apply AltA alone at their desks, the process in Figure 1 can be done quickly. Conversely, its steps should always be followed carefully when conducting a formal AltA workshop with a group of people.\n",

These times vary based on the size of the group conducting the analysis, the problem’s complexity, the technique’s difficulty, and the thoroughness of the work. With practice, most of the techniques can be effectively conducted within an hour, yet some are much quicker if less time is available.

In general, structuring techniques are useful to capture complicated ideas, to share them with others, and to act as a framework for follow-on work.\n",
            "(2) Creative techniques. Creative thinking is the ability to see problems or situations from a fresh perspective and to break out of your frame of reference. Thus, creative techniques increase the number of conceived ideas, and they allow new and imaginative thoughts or novel combinations of them to be generated, too. Additionally, they facilitate innovation, enable group synergy (use the group to create something greater than the sum of the parts), and overcome biases and fixed thinking.\n",

They support problem analysis or the development of alternative perspectives by testing hypotheses, examining lines of reasoning, assessing evidence, and evaluating multiple courses of action. These techniques are often used to identify or diagnose potential problems.\n",
            "(4) Challenge techniques. These methods also go by the names contrarian or competitive and come in three different types: self-critique, critique of others, and critique by others. They challenge current thinking and critique existing mental models, beliefs, or conventions by looking at the problem from a different, often opposing, view.

            "A technique that visually organizes information around a central topic, hence creating a mind map. Such maps consist of a sole concept centred on a page with associated themes, such as images or words, linked to it. These links are commonly established using some structure or organizing scheme. Mind maps therefore literally “map out” ideas by forming relations between them. You can draw them either by hand or using software.\n",

By starting in the middle, your brain has the freedom to spread out in all directions and to express itself more freely.  \n",
            "Step 2: Identify subthemes and draw relationships. Find subthemes to radiate from the central word or image; these are the branches. Use only one or two words to capture your subtheme onto a branch. Now connect them to the central image. In addition, make your branches curved rather than straight lined. (Straight lines and boxes are boring and the opposite of creative!)  \n",
