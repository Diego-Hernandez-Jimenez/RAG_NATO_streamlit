            "AltA is the deliberate application of independent, critical thought and alternative perspective to improve decision-making.  \n",
            "The key words in this description are independent, critical thought, and alternative perspective. First, independent refers to being free from influence or control by others in matters of belief or thinking. Second, critical thought – also known as critical thinking – is the intellectually disciplined process of conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing, and evaluating information. It is necessary for valid reasoning when drawing conclusions about goals, problems, assumptions, concepts, evidence, implications, and consequences. Finally, alternative perspective is the result of looking at a situation, problem, or fact through a different mindset, cultural frame, or value and belief structure.  \n",
            "In other words, AltA is a capability to look at problems in a different way in order to make better-informed decisions. It aims to improve innovation and creativity and to broaden understanding within the staff. To this end, it provides a vehicle to better comprehend the scope of the problem for which staff officers are seeking solutions. Hence, AltA supports them in producing enhanced output in a more efficient manner than relying on unstructured staff meetings or processes. Nevertheless, AltA is intended to supplement rather than duplicate functions performed by staff officers.  \n",
            "AltA comprises of a set of simple techniques that enrich existing processes. They have been taken from industry, intelligence, and academic best practices and are tried-andtested approaches for problem-solving and decision-making. Some techniques such as mind mapping or brainstorming will be familiar to many, others may be less so. The techniques have been specifically chosen as ones that are most useful for NATO.  \n",
            "The AltA capability is aimed at the NATO staff officer; as such, no prior experience or analysis training is necessary. Having said that, experienced analysts will find the techniques a useful complement to their skill set, and the capability is available to non-NATO staff officers.  \n",
            "The AltA capability consists of three main areas: (1) the techniques themselves, (2) education and training in the form of a training course at NATO School Oberammergau, and (3) a community of AltA faclitators. The latter share experiences on NATO’s Transformation Network (TRANSNET) portal under https://portal.transnet.act.nato.int/ Pages/home.aspx (register there for “Operational Analysis, Research and Assessment”).\n",

            "Staff often face complicated tasks. In many instances, not only the answer to a question, but even the question itself and the context surrounding it may be uncertain. This is further aggravated by a lack of specific guidance. Moreover, many staff officers are on a short (three-year) tour of duty, which poses limitations on their ability to become subject-matter experts in the problem. To overcome these challenges, AltA offers techniques that can provide an initial starting point for a task, explore the issues, or generate motivating ideas to start tackling the problem.  \n",
            "Proficient English speakers tend to dominate meetings. International staff consist of members from many different nations with differing language skills. Some staff take longer to process their thoughts into English and can be dominated by those who think and talk quickly without hesitation. AltA addresses this problem by employing techniques that give participants time to gather their thoughts or use visual records to help people remember what was said. Additionally, its methods encourage round-table contributions where everyone gets an opportunity to express their views as well as writing sessions where thoughts are put on paper in silence.  \n",
            "Meetings can be unproductive. The pitfall of long, boring, badly structured, or indecisive meetings without a palpable result is all too common. When employed, the AltA techniques described in this handbook can help to provide structure to a meeting, and some of them also often save time. Likewise, they can produce a tangible, shared outcome that may serve as foundation for follow-up processes.  \n",

            "AltA techniques seek to combat biases. A bias is an inclination – either consciously realized or completely unknown to a person – to present or be pre-disposed towards a particular perspective. This is often accompanied by an intentional or unintentional refusal to reflect upon the possible merits of alternative points of view. Such cognitive biases are present in every individual. AltA techniques tackle them by highlighting and evaluating other perspectives, by focussing on the issue instead of the person expressing it, and by managing arguments in a constructive way.  \n",
            "Biases may appear at group and/or organizational level, too. They can become prevalent in large organizations, especially when there is a high pressure to deliver output. Often it is easier just to agree rather than to upset existing group norms or to fight against established organizational procedures. Operations, working groups on exercises, or day-today office life can easily fall foul of such biases. This is particularly common when the same team has worked together for several months or much time and money has been invested in a project. While considering the permanency of social and cultural factors that exist in NATO, the application of AltA techniques present a useful and viable mitigation for common pitfalls due to biases in the decision-making process.  \n",

            "AltA is intended to be flexible and widely applicable. It builds on existing staff and analytical capabilities where they are available instead of introducing a new entity or staff structure. Generally speaking, AltA rests on eight principles:  \n",
            "(1) AltA is a capability. It is a capability consisting of techniques, training and education, and personnel. This capability is adaptable to meet each organization’s unique needs. For example, a strategic command might organize an ad hoc team to analyse an issue of strategic importance to the Alliance. The operational level might establish a standing team to assist in operations planning and assessment. Other organizations meanwhile might desire staff-wide implementation of these analytical skills to support deeper understanding of the topics they examine.  \n",
            "(2) AltA supports problem-solving. It is performed to support a problem owner with creative problem-solving resources rather than to provide a stand-alone solution to a problem. AltA enhances thinking and creativity with a set of practical and mostly easy-to-apply techniques.  \n",
            "(3) AltA can support a wide range of problems at any level of staff. It has broad applicability, from supporting a single staff officer faced with a problem to the complex decisions encountered by a large staff organization. The AltA techniques have been drawn from national defence organizations, industry, and academia and have been widely used. Learning AltA techniques gives a lifelong career skill set.  \n",
            "(4) AltA provides an independent perspective. To be of value to a decisionmaking process, AltA must be free to deliver impartial or “out-of-the-box” thought that is not constrained by traditional hierarchal structures or organizational pressures.  \n",
            "(5) AltA depends on mutual understanding to realize its full benefits. Problem owners must be willing to accept that the AltA process might be controversial. Simultaneously, AltA must respect the supported/supporting nature of the relationship and be sensitive to the potential impact of its product.  \n",
            "(6) AltA is best applied throughout a process. Its early engagement is ideal to present alternative perspectives and insights in order to better inform the supported process.  \n",
            "(7) AltA benefits from formal direction and guidance. Leaders can help by creating an organizational culture that is willing to use AltA to challenge beliefs and perspectives. The intended use of AltA should be tailored to the organization’s needs without constraining independence and flexibility.  \n",
            "(8) AltA complements existing functions within an organization. It is designed to complement and draw from other existing functions (e.g. operational analysis, operations planning), not to replace or duplicate them.  \n",
            "The AltA process consists of four broad phases: initiation, preparation, application, and termination. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to the AltA process, which is depicted in Figure 1. It offers advice and highlights considerations for the successful application of AltA techniques.  \n",
            "AltA is applicable to any task where it is believed to improve the outcome. For simple applications, e.g. where staff officers apply AltA alone at their desks, the process in Figure 1 can be done quickly. Conversely, its steps should always be followed carefully when conducting a formal AltA workshop with a group of people.\n",

As an aid, the table of techniques on page 18 categorizes them by their ease of application.  \n",

These times vary based on the size of the group conducting the analysis, the problem’s complexity, the technique’s difficulty, and the thoroughness of the work. With practice, most of the techniques can be effectively conducted within an hour, yet some are much quicker if less time is available.

In general, structuring techniques are useful to capture complicated ideas, to share them with others, and to act as a framework for follow-on work.\n",
            "(2) Creative techniques. Creative thinking is the ability to see problems or situations from a fresh perspective and to break out of your frame of reference. Thus, creative techniques increase the number of conceived ideas, and they allow new and imaginative thoughts or novel combinations of them to be generated, too. Additionally, they facilitate innovation, enable group synergy (use the group to create something greater than the sum of the parts), and overcome biases and fixed thinking.\n",

They support problem analysis or the development of alternative perspectives by testing hypotheses, examining lines of reasoning, assessing evidence, and evaluating multiple courses of action. These techniques are often used to identify or diagnose potential problems.\n",
            "(4) Challenge techniques. These methods also go by the names contrarian or competitive and come in three different types: self-critique, critique of others, and critique by others. They challenge current thinking and critique existing mental models, beliefs, or conventions by looking at the problem from a different, often opposing, view.

            "Step 2: Set up brainstorming session. Start the meeting by telling the participants the purpose of the activity, and write the main question on a whiteboard or flip chart. Next, set the ground rules for the session, the most important typically being “no initial criticism of ideas”. Encourage crazy and impractical thoughts at first, because they may spark a more reasonable one later on. Conversely, initial judgement of them may inhibit the thinking process. After all, unconventional thoughts can contain the seeds of an important connection between the topic and an unstated assumption. Other useful ground rules include “one idea per sticky note” and “write legibly so others can read it”.  \n",
            "Step 3: Divergent phase. Motivate the participants to generate as many ideas as possible during this phase without initially judging their quality or practical implications. There are two ways of doing this: One is to distribute pens and sticky notes to each participant, and get them to write their ideas down. As they stick them on the board, they call out their idea for others to hear. This option usually generates the higher number of ideas, but often the sticky notes are hard to read afterwards. The second option is to have participants call out ideas, and the AltA facilitator writes them down and places them on the board. This gives more control over ideas (e.g. the AltA facilitator can rewrite statements with agreement of the group into something legible), but takes more time.  \n",

At this point, new and divergent thoughts are likely to emerge, so invite the participants to review the ideas already on the board. But do not move on too quickly, because sometimes people need pauses to reflect and to start thinking outside the box.  \n",

The participants can do this either by themselves – maybe in silence – or delegate the task to the AltA facilitator. Next, choose a simple word or phrase to describe each category. If the problem owner wants just a quantity of ideas, the brainstorming session can end at this point. Often, however, the problem owner instead wants to receive a few important ideas to work on further; this you can achieve through prioritization. Prioritize: The simplest way of prioritizing is to ask the group which ideas they view as having high priority. Another easy voting method consists of distributing a small number of sticky dots to each participant. Then you request them to stick the dots on the ideas they think are most important. A third option is to let the group rate each idea as being of high, medium, or low importance. Of course, the most suitable technique depends on the nature of the group, the time available, and the number of ideas generated. Nevertheless, ensure that all participants use the same criterion for prioritization by agreeing on it beforehand. For example, vote for the idea that is most likely to succeed or the most innovative one.  \n",

            "(2) History is full of examples of effective deception. Why not here?\n",
            "(4) Were other methods available to rapidly breach the sand berm? It had been necessary to reinforce the canal side of the berm to prevent water erosion.\n",
            "(5) Could recently introduced weapons (for example light anti-tank weapons in Israeli service) protect infantry forces effectively from armoured attack? The defence design relied upon delaying the creation of a large bridgehead, but could infantry alone accomplish this? It was known that the berm would be breached after 24 to 48 hours, permitting armour to cross.\n",
            "(7) The assumption was based upon the arrival of timely reinforcements. Were there circumstances when these would not arrive in time?\n",
            "(9) Even for a highly effective air force, it is expected that some attackers will get through and cause damage.\n",
            "(10) Bridges are not the only method used to cross a water obstacle. Does the opponent has any amphibious forces or capabilities?\n",
            "(11) Would the introduction of newer Soviet air defence systems degrade the IAF’s ability to operate within their protective umbrella?  \n",
            "With hindsight of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, we know that many of the above assumptions were flawed. Syrian and Egyptian war preparations were effectively masked, hence reducing warning time to nine hours. Using water jets, the Egyptian engineers were able to breach the berms in two hours, cutting a total of 81 breaches. Egyptian infantry equipped with anti-armour weapons were highly effective against unsupported Israeli tank units. With these weapons, they prevented armour reinforcements from reaching the forts; several forts fell within only a few hours. The IAF initially suffered significant damage from pre-emptive Egyptian and Syrian air raids, thus exposing reserve ground forces to attack prior to their commitment. The Great Bitter Lake was crossed by amphibious Egyptian armour, which would have been impeded by a sand berm. Finally, the IAF was challenged to operate within the Egyptian air defence umbrella and suffered significant losses.\n",

In this scenario, NATO is facing an aggression of the fictional Bothnian Democratic Republic (BDR) against Estonia.  \n",

Since it was not possible to contemplate all possible combinations in the available time, the group focussed instead on identifying suitable pairings. They subsequently discarded possible pairings that looked only at changes to Alliance decisions because these could be considered as known factors. Finally, the group decided on two futures matrices, one of which is depicted in Figure 18.  \n",
            "Step 5: Generate narratives. The next stage of the futures exercise involved a wider group than was used during the brainstorming phase, encompassing more possible views. They met for one hour led by the AltA facilitator with the futures matrix on a whiteboard and distributed to each participant on paper. Moreover, two scribes recorded the inputs which the AltA facilitator also added onto the whiteboard as the discussion proceeded. Then the AltA facilitator began describing the situation of the top right quadrant of Figure 18 to the participants. That is, BDR launched its invasion of the Estonian island prior to the arrival of NATO forces and was able to take control. Good weather further permitted a rapid insertion of forces by both sea and helicopter-borne forces. Afterwards, BDR rapidly established anti-aircraft defences on the newly seized territory.  \n",

This is affecting the demographic mix of the island to a point where a pro-Bothnian majority will exist.  \n",

Keep your writing clear and legible so that people can correct your misinterpretations. Also ask for confirmation or clarification if you are not sure what to write down. Equally important is capturing all views; not writing down someone’s idea is a quick way to turn that person into a silent participant.

All of this non-verbal behaviour of yours – the gestures you make, the way you sit, how fast or how loud you talk, how close you stand, how much eye contact you make – sends strong messages. These messages do not stop when you stop speaking either. Accordingly, even when you are silent, you are still communicating non-verbally. As an AltA facilitator, you thus need to be very well attuned to the non-verbal communication during the facilitated session.  \n",
            "Often, what comes out of somebody’s mouth and what they communicate through their body language are two totally different things. When faced with these mixed signals, you have to choose whether to believe the verbal or non-verbal message. In most cases, you should decide on the non-verbal one. This is because it is a natural, unconscious language that broadcasts true feelings and intentions at any given moment.\n",

            "People are naturally conservative, and having no intention to change what they do or how they do it, they are often comfortable with the status quo. Therefore, they need to be persuaded of the benefits of a proposed change, probably without them fully understanding all implications of this proposal. As an AltA facilitator, you will hear a multitude of reasons why something will not work, ranging from “we tried that before” through “we have always done it that way” to “it can’t be done” and “not invented here”.  \n",
            "Individuals resist change for many reasons, but largely because they perceive it as negative or do not want to deal with the causes for its necessity. This resistance will manifest itself in what people say and, often more importantly, in what they do. You must hence be alert in identifying it by watching how people behave and listening carefully to what they say and also what they do not say.  \n",
            "You can deal with resistance in three fundamental steps:  \n",
            "Step 1: Identify the form the resistance is taking. Trust what you see more than what you hear, listen to yourself and use your own feelings as a barometer. Also pay attention to repetition/telltale phrases.  \n",
            "Step 2: Acknowledge and name the resistance. Tell the person your perception of the resistance, but do it in a win-win, neutral, non-aggressive manner, e.g. “What I think I hear you saying is....” Also tell the person how the resistance makes you feel.  \n",
            "Step 3: Be quiet, listen, and let the person respond. Get the person talking, encourage full expression of the concerns, and gradually uncover the underlying resistance/issue. However, be aware of other forms of resistance surfacing.  \n",
            "Ideally you would do all that you can to minimize the resistance before having to deal with the implications of it. Thus, be sensitive that many staff officers will initially be uncomfortable with applying some of the AltA techniques. To help you reduce the impact of this problem, a few strategies are listed below:  \n",
            " identify the benefits; explain why change is necessary; invite and answer questions – solicit participation and, if possible, early involvement; avoid surprises – overcommunicate; recognize and reward effort;\n",
